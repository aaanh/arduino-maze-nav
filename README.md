# Physics for Engineers Winter 2020 Final Project

## Project specifications:

Build a vehicle that can drive through a RNGesus single-path maze with 90-degree turns in the shortest period of time possible. Vehicle needs to be 3D printed, using ultrasonic sensors, bipedal and up, using Arduino Uno board as the logic controller for driving motors/servo(s), turning wheels, and sensory I/Os, fit in a predetermined box (volume-limited).

## Project source code
- Generated through `circuito.io`, source in `/Firmware`
- Home-baked and sizzled codizzle which izzle included inizzle `main.ino`

## Other project source codes
- This is a consortium for every code base leading up to this project coded by Team 7 - Naruto (developer), Sasuke (tester), Sakura (HR), Kakashi (manager), Sai (intern but actually corporate spy), Yamato (substitute manager but has no idea what's going on). &rightarrow; Don't ask me how I remember this on a whim while writing this documentation.
- Code snippets can be found categorized in `/challenges`
